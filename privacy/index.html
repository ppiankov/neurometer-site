  <h2>What Neurometer Is</h2>
  <p>
    Neurometer is an instrument that visualizes departure pressure in real time.
    It detects when people leave a zone, not how many are there. A high reading
    means many departures — it says nothing about availability or occupancy.
    Neurometer does not measure people, minds, emotions, or intent — it measures
    environments only.
  </p>

  <h2>What Data Is Processed</h2>
  <p>
    When a user opts into the contribution service, the app transmits anonymous
    departure events consisting of a zone identifier and a timestamp. These
    events are aggregated into time-windowed pressure signals and expire. No
    individual event history is retained. No data is processed unless the user
    explicitly enables contribution.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Not Collected</h2>
  <p>
    Neurometer does not collect device identifiers, user accounts, location
    history, analytics, cookies, or any form of personal data. The app contains
    no analytics SDKs, no advertising frameworks, and no tracking pixels. When
    contribution is disabled, no location access occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    No individual departure events are sold, shared, or exposed to third
    parties. Neurometer contains no ad networks, no analytics services,
    and no social media integrations. Individual signals are aggregated
    server-side and never exposed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aggregated, non-identifiable pressure readings may be made available
    through commercial partnerships. These readings contain no individual
    signals and cannot be traced to any device or person.
